# Here are screenshots of my crud application
This first screenshot shows learners that are already registered so we need to add new learners

This second screenshot shows the backend database of my Crud Application which is MySQL, so everytime we add a new learner
their information/data will be also stored here in MySQL, those are my records that I have thus far.
